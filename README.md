# Pokemon Database Coursework

This repo details and displays all current aspects of my A-Level Computer Science coursework.\
Everything is subject to change, and as of current, the project is far from finished.

The project gets updated almost daily, though the repo itself wont be.

## Current Features
● Custom UI system\
● Tilemap and Collision system\
● Coroutine system\
● State machines (e.g., used within the battle system)\
● Work-in-progress database with basic queries

## Notes
The project is updated almost daily, though commits to this repository may not reflect every small change.

Everything here is subject to change as development progresses.

If you’d like to follow progress, check back every week or two for updates.
